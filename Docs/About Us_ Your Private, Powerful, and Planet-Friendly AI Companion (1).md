# About Us: Your Private, Powerful, and Planet-Friendly AI Companion

In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping our world, **Dr. Ernesto Lee** believes that its power should be in the hands of everyone, not locked away in distant data centers controlled by corporations. Dr. Lee envisions a future where AI is a tool for empowerment, creativity, and connection—a future that is both technologically advanced and deeply human. This vision is the heart of **MyML.app**.

Dr. Lee has created a unique platform that offers a safe and private space for you to explore the limitless potential of AI. MyML.app is built on the principle that you should have complete control over your data and your digital footprint. That's why the AI runs entirely on your device. Nothing is ever sent to the cloud, no one is monitoring your interactions, and your privacy is unconditionally protected. In a world where surveillance has become the norm, MyML.app stands as a beacon of digital freedom.

## Our Mission: AI for Everyone, with Responsibility

Dr. Lee's mission is to democratize access to powerful AI tools while addressing the critical concerns of our time: privacy, environmental sustainability, and the digital divide. MyML.app is committed to providing an AI experience that is:

**Private by Design:** Your conversations and creations are yours alone. By running on your device, MyML.app eliminates the privacy risks associated with cloud-based AI. Your data never leaves your computer. There are no terms of service that grant corporations the right to analyze your thoughts, no algorithms tracking your behavior, and no surveillance infrastructure monitoring your every interaction. Dr. Lee built MyML.app on the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or a premium feature. In an age where your data is constantly being harvested and monetized, MyML.app offers a sanctuary where you can think freely, create boldly, and explore without fear of being watched.

**Environmentally Conscious:** The massive data centers that power most AI applications consume vast amounts of energy, contributing to climate change and environmental destruction. These facilities require constant cooling, consume electricity equivalent to entire cities, and leave a carbon footprint that grows larger every day. By leveraging the power of your own device, MyML.app significantly reduces the carbon footprint of AI, making it a more sustainable technology for a healthier planet. Dr. Lee designed MyML.app with the understanding that technology should be part of the solution to our environmental crisis, not part of the problem. Every time you use MyML.app instead of a cloud-based service, you're making a choice that benefits the planet. If you care about the environment, choosing on-device AI is one of the most meaningful actions you can take in your digital life.

**Bridging the Digital Divide:** Dr. Lee believes that everyone, regardless of their economic status or location, should have access to the benefits of AI. MyML.app is **completely free to use**, with no hidden costs, subscription fees, or token limits. There are no paywalls, no premium tiers, and no artificial restrictions on what you can do. It even works offline, making it accessible to those with limited or no internet connectivity. This commitment to universal access means that a student in a rural village has the same AI capabilities as a researcher at a prestigious university. It means that teachers with limited budgets can provide their students with world-class AI tools. It means that communities that have been left behind by the digital revolution can finally participate in the AI age. MyML.app is Dr. Lee's answer to the question: what if AI served everyone, not just the wealthy?

## The Technology Behind the Vision

To make this vision a reality, Dr. Lee has built MyML.app on a foundation that leverages the latest breakthroughs in on-device artificial intelligence. The platform incorporates Google's Gemma 3 and Gemma 3n models, which represent significant advances in AI research and development. However, MyML.app is far more than just an implementation of these models—it is Dr. Lee's comprehensive platform that combines these foundational technologies with innovative optimizations, thoughtful design, and a commitment to serving humanity.

The underlying models are incredibly powerful and remarkably efficient, allowing them to run smoothly on a wide range of devices—from high-end workstations to modest laptops and even mobile devices. Dr. Lee has optimized every aspect of the platform to ensure that powerful AI is accessible to everyone, regardless of their hardware.

For broader compatibility, MyML.app also integrates WebLLM to support a variety of other models, ensuring that everyone can experience the magic of on-device AI. This combination of cutting-edge technology allows MyML.app to offer a rich, multimodal AI experience that includes text, image, and audio understanding, all while respecting your privacy and our planet.

**Supporting 140+ Languages:** Dr. Lee designed MyML.app to serve the entire world, not just English speakers. The platform supports over 140 languages, ensuring that people from every corner of the globe can access AI in their native tongue. This linguistic diversity is essential for bridging the digital divide and ensuring that AI benefits all of humanity, not just a privileged few.
