## 📝 Notes

- **MediaPipe Integration**: Currently using MediaPipe LLM Inference API. Some advanced Gemma 3n features may require direct integration with transformers.js or custom implementation.
- **Browser Limitations**: Some features (real-time camera/mic) require secure context (HTTPS) and user permissions.
- **Memory Constraints**: Browser memory limits may affect 32K context window usage. Monitor and implement smart context management.
- **Model Availability**: Verify that Gemma 3n models are available in MediaPipe-compatible format for all features.
