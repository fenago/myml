4. **Conversation Templates** - Pre-built conversation starters for common tasks
5. **Multi-model Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of different models
6. **Usage Analytics** - Better insights into token usage and costs
7. **Conversation Tags** - Organize conversations with tags and categories

### Low Priority
8. **Collaboration Features** - Sharing and collaborative sessions
9. **Advanced Accessibility** - Enhanced screen reader and keyboard navigation
10. **GitHub Gist Integration** - Share code snippets directly to Gist

- Message editing creates new variations but doesn't show variation UI yet

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular dependency updates
- Performance optimization review
- Code splitting implementation
- Test coverage expansion
- Documentation updates
