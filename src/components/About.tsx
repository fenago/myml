              In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping our world, <strong>Dr. Ernesto Lee</strong> believes that its power should be in the hands of everyone, not locked away in distant data centers controlled by corporations. Dr. Lee envisions a future where AI is a tool for empowerment, creativity, and connection‚Äîa future that is both technologically advanced and deeply human. This vision is the heart of <strong>MyML.app</strong>.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Dr. Lee has created a unique platform that offers a safe and private space for you to explore the limitless potential of AI. MyML.app is built on the principle that you should have complete control over your data and your digital footprint. That's why the AI runs entirely on your device. Nothing is ever sent to the cloud, no one is monitoring your interactions, and your privacy is unconditionally protected. In a world where surveillance has become the norm, MyML.app stands as a beacon of digital freedom.

                  Your conversations and creations are yours alone. By running on your device, MyML.app eliminates the privacy risks associated with cloud-based AI. Your data never leaves your computer. There are no terms of service that grant corporations the right to analyze your thoughts, no algorithms tracking your behavior, and no surveillance infrastructure monitoring your every interaction. Dr. Lee built MyML.app on the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or a premium feature. In an age where your data is constantly being harvested and monetized, MyML.app offers a sanctuary where you can think freely, create boldly, and explore without fear of being watched.

                  The massive data centers that power most AI applications consume vast amounts of energy, contributing to climate change and environmental destruction. These facilities require constant cooling, consume electricity equivalent to entire cities, and leave a carbon footprint that grows larger every day. By leveraging the power of your own device, MyML.app significantly reduces the carbon footprint of AI, making it a more sustainable technology for a healthier planet. Dr. Lee designed MyML.app with the understanding that technology should be part of the solution to our environmental crisis, not part of the problem. Every time you use MyML.app instead of a cloud-based service, you're making a choice that benefits the planet.

MyML.app is <strong>completely free to use</strong>, with no hidden costs, subscription fees, or token limits. There are no paywalls, no premium tiers, and no artificial restrictions on what you can do. It even works offline, making it accessible to those with limited or no internet connectivity. This commitment to universal access means that a student in a rural village has the same AI capabilities as a researcher at a prestigious university.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              To make this vision a reality, Dr. Lee has built MyML.app on a foundation that leverages the latest breakthroughs in on-device artificial intelligence. The platform incorporates Google's Gemma 3 and Gemma 3n models, which represent significant advances in AI research and development. However, MyML.app is far more than just an implementation of these models‚Äîit is Dr. Lee's comprehensive platform that combines these foundational technologies with innovative optimizations, thoughtful design, and a commitment to serving humanity.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The underlying models are incredibly powerful and remarkably efficient, allowing them to run smoothly on a wide range of devices‚Äîfrom high-end workstations to modest laptops and even mobile devices. Dr. Lee has optimized every aspect of the platform to ensure that powerful AI is accessible to everyone, regardless of their hardware.
